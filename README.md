Exercise 3.20 JHTP (Salary Calculator): Develop a Java application that determines the gross pay for each of three (3) employees. The company pays straight time for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and time and a half for all hours worked in excess of 40. You’re given a list of employees, their number of hours worked last week, and their hourly rates [create your own information/data here to input into the program]. Your program should input this information/data for each employee, then determine and display the employee’s gross pay. Use class Scanner to input the employee data.
